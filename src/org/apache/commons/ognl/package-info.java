/**
 * OGNL stands for Object-Graph Navigation Language; it is an expression language
 * for getting and setting properties of Java objects. You use the same expression
 * for both getting and setting the value of a property.
 *
 * OGNL started out as a way to set up associations between UI
 * components and controllers using property names.  As the desire for
 * more complicated associations grew, Drew Davidson created what he
 * called KVCL, for Key-Value Coding Language, egged on by Luke
 * Blanshard.  Luke then reimplemented the language using ANTLR, came up
 * with the new name, and, egged on by Drew, filled it out to its current
 * state.
 *
 * We pronounce OGNL as a word, like the last syllables of a drunken
 * pronunciation of "orthogonal" or like "ogg-null".
